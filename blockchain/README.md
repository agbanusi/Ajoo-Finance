Micro-Lending: The protocol facilitates peer-to-peer micro-loans, enabling members to lend or borrow small amounts of cryptocurrency with customizable terms and collateral requirements. 4. P2P Lending Marketplace: A decentralized platform where lenders and borrowers can connect directly, setting their own terms within the framework of the protocol's smart contracts.
Custodial and Family Savings: Ajoo offers multi-signature wallets and time-locked savings accounts, perfect for family savings or custodial accounts for minors. Parents can set up accounts for their children with customizable withdrawal rules and beneficiary designations. 6. Decentralized Governance: Token holders can participate in the protocol's decision-making process, voting on proposals for feature updates, risk parameters, and fund allocations. 7. Yield Optimization: Idle funds in savings accounts are automatically allocated to various DeFi protocols to generate additional yield for users.
Cross-Chain Compatibility: Ajoo aims to operate across multiple blockchain networks, maximizing accessibility and liquidity. 9. Mobile-First Approach: A user-friendly mobile app makes it easy for anyone with a smartphone to access Ajoo's services, bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi. -->
